# wgcf-connector
Extract Cloudflare [WARP Connector](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/warp-connector/) WireGuard configuration.

Cloudflare WARP is an overlay network like ZeroTier and Tailscale but instead of peer-to-peer, you connect to the nearest Cloudflare PoP using WireGuard.\
Finally, a free site-to-site VPN from Cloudflare.

This program uses the `warp-cli` Linux client, installs it inside the Docker container, register WARP Connector with the token, and then extract the configuration file.

## Usage
1. [Create a tunnel](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/networks/tunnels/add/warp) in Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard with WARP Connector as tunnel type.
2. Copy the generated WARP Connector token starting with `eyJhIjoi` and paste it as argument `<token>` in Docker.
3. It will output wgcf-connector-<registration_id>.conf file in your current working directory, which you can use in WireGuard.

> [!TIP]
> If you got an endpoint IPv4 address starting with `162.159.192.x`, use `162.159.193.x` instead to have lower latency.
